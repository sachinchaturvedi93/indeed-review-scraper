" January 6, 2019",Customer Success Manager," Reston, VA ",Family,"building and sustaining a healthy workplace culture, it’s necessary to ask the question, “are we a team here, or are we a family?” A team has a common goal. The needs and positions of the team may vary, but the end result is to win. This means that teammates build up their fellow comrades, celebrate their successes, and encourage them when they’ve had a down moment. They come together to bond and unite for the greater outcome. At times, this may mean picking up the extra slack or offering to assist in an area outside of your “job description.” We do this willingly, because we know that when we put in the time, the team shares in the fruits of the labor, and that the commitment to that common goal benefits everyone.

Often times you hear businesses say, “We’re a family here.” Though that may be a good theory, difficulties remain, as you most likely won’t fire a family member because they have been late 365 days in a row. While a family environment encourages personal relationships, a sense of community and a feeling of security, it may also discourage competition, lower expectations, or struggle with visible accountability.",5.0,5,5,5,5,5

I was provided challenging work and opportunities to develop skills I already acquired in previous roles. I was able to provide impact to the project I found myself on, and develop good working relationships with the client and my coworkers over the course of a few months.

However, it occurred to me that ManTech acquired these individuals through acquisition, and had moved previous management out with their own. New management began to remove those individuals in favor of saving costs and the project suffered. Those that remained flagged severe issues within the project, and reminded management of how critical certain individuals were. None of this was taken into consideration.

Currently, I find myself in several meetings over the course of a week, unable to finish work I was brought on for. Management continues to shirk responsibility for the current status, and waves off issues brought up by teams.
