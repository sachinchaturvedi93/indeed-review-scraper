There are only a few things I would change. The cost of living far outweighs the salary earned if you have student loans. If you don't have debt, then is easy by living with roommates or working a second job to live in San Diego within a reasonable commute (1hr commute in the PM). Most of the people on base chose to live out of the city limits, and spend between 1.5-2 hours commuting home.
