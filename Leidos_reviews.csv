" June 20, 2020",CBRN Technician, Undisclosed ,"Good company possibilities, but no oversight of contracts","Big Leidos:
Working for Leidos has really good potential, IF you can get in. The Leidos corporation offers methods and opportunities for career advancement, education, and getting recognized for your work. The problem is that Leidos is a company that doesn't believe in responding to applications, if you're not best qualified (including internal ones!). So you'll just be sitting there wondering what happened or if you were even qualified or not, without the opportunity for an interview, so make sure your resume is TOP notch!

Compensation and benefits are pretty generous with Leidos for contract work; not many contracting companies offer such a good deal. Leidos definitely needs more oversight in their contracts. If they did, I'm sure several people would no longer be working. But big Leidos doesn't seem to be anywhere to be found, even after company surveys revealed poor management and low employee satisfaction.

Contract Leidos:
Work/life balance is great, with great flexibility when you need time off, but again, not sure if that's Leidos in general or just the contract I'm on.
Although Leidos offers ways to get recognized through bonuses and such, you have to first have a manager that actually ""manages"" and cares about his people and their reputation and careers. Instead you get more and more responsibility, without any advancement; so you'll just sit at the same level you were hired, with twice the responsibility.

" December 4, 2019",Analyst, USAF ,Bottom line over people,"I have worked for Leidos on two occasions at two separate locations/contracts.

In my first experience I found Leidos to be very hands off as we worked at a government site rather than a Leidos site. While this was beneficial to the government client and the ability to fulfill tasks without extra corporate taskers, I found it lacking in career advancement. With no true Leidos supervisor on site, there were no discussions on how to advance in the company, career progression or official feedback on performance.

This was contrasted sharply when I switched companies and found that they provided onsite management, took a vested interest in my career and provided ample opportunities and training to achieve my goals.

When I had to go back to Leidos I had reservations but hoped that my experience was a one-off. This was not the case. The culture remains the same - my supervision is several hours away with communication occurring only when required training is due. The leadership does not communicate with the client to determine if needs are being met or to get feedback from the client on jobs well done etc.

The leave policies/accruals are much more stringent than my last company (a big player in the defense industry) and the maternity leave policy is significantly less than I've seen elsewhere. One week of leave and one week of disability. Everything else must be accrued PTO or LWOP.

At the end of the day, the human aspect of Leidos as a company is lacking. I thoroughly enjoy my coworkers, but the administrative aspects are infuriating.",2.0,2,2,2,1,1

He will not defend his employees no matter how hard they work, how many languages they speak, and what kind of higher education degrees they hold.

And if qualified native linguists (multiple language skills, 10+ years of experience, higher education (B.S and Masters degrees)) have complained, the PM will NOT hire you or will be fired.

" December 18, 2018",Project Manager," Washington, DC ",Office location matters; heavy management; too much stress for government contracting,"Potentially a good place to work, or a bad place, depending entirely on which office and location you might be working, and/or your manager. Our office was highly removed from the corporate culture (people wore jeans), but stuck with highly bureaucratic IT solutions infrastructure, and poorly managed and dated offices (make sure to visit the office you will actually be located... you might need a dust mask if you are at an off-site location, or better off if with a client).

As a government contractor, our contract was really a niche product offering. ""Top-heavy"" management made work here difficult if you want advancement or realistic promotion, especially the new managers who can be pretty aggressive to some. There are also ""remote"" managers that is not the best, and lower supervisors frequently come and go more quickly. Direction often was to 'do this' but not clearly help new employees on the best or preferred ways to get things done. Instead there are a lot of recriminations and stress after the fact. Lots of running around with their heads cut off to resolve a new fire everyday, instead of a smooth well oiled machine.

Meanwhile, there are some co-workers that really are talented and skilled, but they're probably underused, but then there are other employees that you have no idea what they even do. Fair balance of men/women employees, and diverse, but older crowd so not as innovative or flexible work culture.
