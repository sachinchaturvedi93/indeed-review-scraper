You always have the impression their priority is their bonus, nothing else mattered as they continued to demand more and more work with fewer people.

They were slow to replace people when they quit and more frequently opted not to because they wanted to skew the numbers to make their bonus. The culture is toxic and the high attrition rate is the result. There are a few people that have been there for years and are willing to help but more often you’re thrown in and no one has time to help you so you drown at your desk until you just decide to leave. Nepotism runs high and definitely is a “who you know” environment. Also the constant Reorgs were ridiculous and added to needless work and lack of continuity.

The best thing I can say about my three years there is I did meet some wonderful people that will remain lifelong friends. It saddens me to hear the toxic environment has gotten worse, I didn’t think that was possible. If you are choosing between a few offers and RMS is in the mix, I’d think long and hard about your decision.

They place people based on their perceived need, not based on the strengths a person has.
