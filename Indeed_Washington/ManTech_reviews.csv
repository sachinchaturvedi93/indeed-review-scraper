" July 9, 2020",Information Security Specialist," Washington, DC ",Good Tech Field Entry Point,"ManTech is your typical government contractor. The bid on lowest possible acceptable offer so don't expect to get paid nearly what you are worth. Also don't expect any upwards mobility unless new contracts get won. On the bright side they are a larger company and win contract fairly often. That are also an amazing entry point for getting into the tech field right out of school. They will assist with training and they will be more than happy to sponsor you for a clearance which will set you up for bigger and better things. They have been around a while so they know how to play the contractor game. The work may get mundane at times but corporate treats you well even if they under pay you. Even if you leave to somewhere else, once they have a contract to pay you well or promote you their recruiters will follow up to try and bring you back.",3,1,1,1,1,3

All he did was criticize, cut me down verbally and degrade me.","I was not given any indoctrination to my job. No one offered me help or advice when I first started. I had to search and ask for the appropriate documents after being on-site for 2 months. There was no guidebook, instruction, or SOP for my position.
