You have to re-apply for the jobs you find yourself in the company. They will allow you a 2 month or so wait in between but it really depends on your manager and if you have a champion. You may have to take any job just to stay billable and not the job you were originally hired for.

At Booz Allen, only the highet level folks actually have their own cube or space, the rest of us lowbies fight for open seats. I never could find a seat and could not focus. Booz has gone on a major hiring spree for younger professionals fresh out of college, which is fine until you are seated beside a team of them. It is as if every young group of professionals I encountered in the building would walk around in hoards together screaming and clowning and talking about partying at the top of their lungs. Impossible to concentrate in these environments.

My personal manager could not have cared less about me from day one, never gave me the time of day, never told me what to do or what needs to be done. Unbelievable really. I don't think my distaste is as much for Booz Allen as it is for my specific Manager and my team. It has just been a really bad experience, I regret leaving my previous employer to come here. Be careful chasing the money people, sometimes you make a lot more to be a lot more miserable. Blessing in disguise that layoffs are coming in hard.

The benefits package at Booz Allen has been one of the best I have seen amongst any other firm out there. They make sure to take care of their employees and that they truly have a great work life balance.

The work culture is fantastic, regardless of age and experience everyone there has a entrepreneurial mind set and is out going, you can’t help to be out going. Everyone I worked with was friendly and was willing to help me with any questions I had. The managers also recognize anyone for their hard work ethic and they make sure to move you up in the organization.

I would highly recommend to anyone to work for Booz Allen Hamilton.",5,5,5,4,5,5
" March 19, 2020",Associate, District of Columbia ,Run Away,BAH is so inconsistent with regards to pay and promotion. They preach that they care about their employees but they don’t act on it by improving benefits. The culture is “give give give” but don’t you dare try to take.

- if you win a hackathon, someone from the company will call it a ""Booz Allen win"" and fail to give you credit.
- if you pitch an idea, someone will take credit for it and you'll never get time to work on it. No one will believe you came up with it, no one will show respect for you, no one will ask if you have other ideas, no one will offer help finding a position that would allow you to work on your ideas, no one will offer help finding resources outside the company to enable you to work on your ideas, there will just be no response & eventually you'll notice someone else stole your idea and implemented a terrible version of it that missed the point of the invention.
- There is no support for inventors. There is, however, ridicule for people with any ideas at all, let alone excellent ideas, because their business model rewards lying to government agencies to get contracts, and then executing the terrible unnecessary projects detailed in the contracts.

The company's recruiting scripts blur the line between fact and fiction to attract talent that would otherwise decline. The cultural environment is bizarre; the company prioritizes social interaction among employees over producing high-quality work products for clients. The lack of honesty, transparency, and appropriate focus make for a less than tenable situation for those seeking a substantive and rewarding career platform.

However, about 95%+ of the work is with the Federal Government and the firm has started to increasingly align its culture, practices, and structure with the Federal Government - the same Federal Government we are hired to try to help/fix. Lots of ""butts in seats"" work with little creativity or critical thinking and a hyper-risk averse environment that micromanages and kills good ideas reflexively. The brand seems to be slowly decaying away as we look for way to squeeze more money out of the government without fixing the underlying issues of incompetence, laziness, bureaucracy and cronyism.

" June 30, 2019",Senior Associate," Washington, DC ",Heavy handed company; a shadow of it's former self,"I worked for Booz Allen twice. The first time was for 6 years, before-9/11. The second time was for just over 10 years. In that time, it became a very heavy handed company. During my first stint with Booz, it was a very innovative, smart, and agile consulting company. Certainly top shelf. Today, they lack opportunities for innovation, creativity, and growth. While they claim to “empower people to change the world.” I’ve never seen anyone change anything at Booz Allen. Banding is based on the old Booz Allen, not what exists today.

Post Snowden they setup an insider threat program to monitor employee behavior. When I was there, they made everyone sign a legal waiver to be continually monitored. This included ongoing background checks, credit checks, social media, computer, cell phone, blogs, news reports, etc.

Most work these days is “buts in seats” at government offices under the supervision of a government employee. It can be years before you even visit a Booz Allen facility. Unless you work with your manager onsite, you might only see them once a month or less. You still have to do daily time sheets, annual assessments, and other admin functions. The company no longer provides computers to new employees; no laptop, cell phone, etc. You have to use your own computer for admin functions; other than your timesheet, you can’t do Booz Allen admin functions on a government computer. For the most part, you’re a bit like a temp employee outsourced to a government agency.

I found that trying to find a job internally was no less stressful nor easier than finding a job anywhere, so I opted to go independent where I spent much less time on internal business, reviews, etc. and the slight decrease in job security was more than made up for with greater compensation and control over my future.",3,5,3,1,2,3

" February 20, 2019",Associate," Washington, DC ","Good company, but leaders are a mixed bag","Your experience will be completely dependent on your leadership. If you work on a team with confident/competent leaders who believe in communication and are actively engaged in professional growth and development, you will be challenged in all the right ways and your experience will be amazing. If your leadership is weak, fear-filled, or insecure, turn and run and never look back. You will spend your nights and weekends working tirelessly to assuage their egos, inadequacies, and inability to properly set or communicate priorities.

Certain markets and teams are better than others. Focus on external engagement; work and build a portfolio across clients and skill-sets.

Do extra research if you're exploring internal options -- they are seen as expensive overhead completely removed from the general experience; largely a detriment to the firm (think The Capitol in Hunger Games). There is some expertise and creativity, but mostly smoke and mirrors. A lot of add-on, ad-hoc, high cost/low value certifications to distract from a highly reactive culture which specializes in manufactured urgency, a lack of transparency, and cloudy expectations.

Throw your hat in the ring and give it a try. It's great for some, terrible for others, and short-lived by most. Assess your situation quickly though. Make it work for you and leave the minute it doesn't. There's no point investing your time in fixing things here. What's broken has been firmly rooted and supported for over 100 years.
