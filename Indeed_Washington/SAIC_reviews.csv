" March 23, 2020",Principal Network Engineer," Washington, DC ",Just like any big corporation,"SAIC has its positives and negatives, nothing stands out from either category. It's a company that is getting bigger with the addition of two companies that it purchased recently, Engility and Unisys. I've worked at both if these companies in the past, and those companies suck big time. Let's hope the workplace habits of those companies does not seep into the SAIC culture.",4,4,4,3,2,3
" February 21, 2020",Anonymous," Washington, DC ",Demanding,Over all an average place to work. This can be a demanding place with many taskers that require working more than a 40 hour work week. At times it can require working late into the evenings and some weekends.,3,3,3,4,3,3
" February 7, 2020",EA, District of Columbia ,Changing constantly,this used to be the place to work (i.e. before 2016) but as they started acquiring new companies and bringing those other employees on and letting loyal competent SAIC employees go....things began to go downhill. It is indicative of current culture but I always hoped this company would not give in to the trends. that did not happen. flex time and remote work is sometimes allowed. workloads are heavy!,3,2,4,2,3,3

" January 2, 2020",Senior Telecommunications Engineer," Washington, DC ",Various Opportunities,"SAIC has a plethora of opportunities. However, I didn't like how they handle my contract. We got laid off with no advance notice which left a bad taste.",4,4,4,4,4,4
" December 20, 2019",Library Associate/Data and Metrics Associate/Data Archivist," Washington, DC ","Excellent people and a good working environment, with a hands-off aproach","I worked with great people who fostered a good environment, provided great feedback on my work, and let me know to start looking for a new job with ample notice.

" August 22, 2019",Tier II Desktop Support Technician," Washington, DC ",Trash Company,Bad news from start to finish. Small bonuses. The company does not care about its employees only its bottom line. Sad to see such a huge company do less but expect more for its employees.,1,4,4,1,1,1
" August 4, 2019",Field Service Engineer II/Queue Manager," Washington, DC ",Employee Dedication,"SAIC is a very good company to work for. I have had an excellent experience with them. SAIC does pride themselves in trying to hold on to their employees when a contract has ended or a person gets laid off. They do invest in trying to keep their staff when things happen. I am not sure why I am getting all these questions on SAIC, the company is well structured and have been around in the Government Contracting Business for a long time and they are good at what they do!",5,5,5,5,5,5

" June 14, 2019",Systems Administrator," Washington, DC ",O.k. But There Are Problems,"I work in a tiny office where everyone there feels threatened by each other, except for one person. There is no teamwork there and mostly everyone, including the new guy of 2 weeks, are superficial towards each other. They need to learn how to work as a team and communicate more. Also, the company need to streamline their hiring processes to hire quality people, rather than the people that are just there simply to collect a paycheck, stay lazy and be disrespectful to senior employees. In addition, when they promote from within, they select sometimes people that are not qualified to deal with the power that goes with it. On the other hand, people at the main office are super-chill and are cohesive team players.",4,4,3,3,2,2
" April 1, 2019",Data Converged Engineer," Washington, DC ",Great place to work,"Great place to work and the only reason I am moving on is due to a contract change. Working on a Government contract definitely had it’s ups and downs, mostly ups. Being a retired Marine I meet a lot of new people mostly prior enlist. They worked hard and made the job fun. One thing that’s hard though is when losing a contract and the company has to shut the program down. Lots of people were laid off, but SAIC does give you 30 days with pay to look for another job or find another job within the company with the help of their relocation program, although it has been hard for me to find a new job within the company. I would love to stay but I guess it’s just time for me to move on.",4,4,4,4,4,4

" January 8, 2019",Program Analyst," Washington, DC ",Light Corporate Touch,"My time at SAIC has been on a single contract. My take is that the culture largely depends on the contract one supports; the projects and priorities often touted on the corporate intranet don't always align with how the satellite offices operate. Rather, the office will - quite understandably - try to mirror initiatives that the government customer is concerned with.",3,2,4,3,3,2
