" January 20, 2020",Investigator," Washington, DC ",Worst job I've ever had,"This job is setup to allow the company succeed and not so much you as an employee. Investigators submit their reports to a group of reviewers who will send the report back to you for corrections. This is to assure that the best possible report gets sent to the customer. Your career as an Investigator is based off of your quality score and production. But it's your career and promotion on the line if....another Investigator or reviewer messed up; a new reviewer worked on your case and had it checked by a senior reviewer who is trying to prove their worth by showing the newbie how it's done. So, essentially, you are screwed. Oh, and you're supposed to stay for a year or you have to pay them back the money they spent on you. Good luck being burnt out by month 5 and having no way out unless you want to pay back >$7k. Otherwise, you're stuck trying to save your career from having a termination on the record.",1,1,1,1,2,1
" September 19, 2019",Background Investigator," Washington, DC ","Productive, and you work remotely with a lot of positions","The job is very tedious and the company expects a lot from you. It is pretty difficult to be able to get a raise unless you overwork yourself. A typical work day can be long when a lot of work cramming is involved. Only the strong survives. The management team is pretty good. As long as you are working diligently, they do not bother you.",3,2,5,3,5,3
" September 16, 2019",Investigator IV," Washington, DC ","Good coworkers, bad metrics, okay pay","They have a lot of internal work to get everyone on the same page, but the people who work there care and are good to work with. Pay is below average, but they take entry level.",4,5,3,3,3,3
" July 18, 2019",Special Investigator," Washington, DC ",Overworked and Underpaid,"Review title pretty much sums it up for me. Ridiculous amounts of case work with high expectations to have them completed efficiently before deadlines. Very dysfunctional company that couldn't give straight answers for anything. For example, higher ups and even HR didn't even have a clue regarding parental leave or benefits. Always gave the run around and received different answers from different people. They don't even make it clear to us what clearance we have. Had to hear it from a federal recruiter from a job I was applying for. Also it's pretty bad on your first day at training, your instructor warns you that you will have no life while working this job. Funny thing is that she's right. Recommend for retirees who are bored or college kids getting their first big boy job.",2,3,1,2,3,2
" May 14, 2019",Background Investigator," Washington, DC ",Worst Job,Extremely misleading. Horrible place to work. If you think that you will be receiving a clearance that is false and you will be working for very little and no reward.,1,1,1,1,1,1
" January 10, 2019",Special Investigator II," Washington, DC ",Great Job,"Pros:
-work from home office
-make your own schedule (from this I learned more effective time management)
-exposure to people in a variety of professions and industries
-decent benefits
-bonuses are not hard to make

Cons:
-there's a lot of work to be done and unless you get a *good mentor and a reasonable supervisor, you're in for a difficult learning curve---a *stressful learning curve.
-once you get over that curve, you have to maintain an increasing workload
-repetitive work

Other info:
-though the work is repetitive, you're always in different locations and aren't stuck in your office all day.
-learned about different contractors and fed agencies in my area
-made contacts in different organizations
-my management is great, though you sometimes get the feeling that you're working a lot more cases and getting paid less than people in other similar companies (several colleagues of mine have left to different organizations and I'm aware their compensation is much higher and with lower case loads).",5,5,4,5,5,3
" December 15, 2018",Background Investigator," Washington, DC ",Job Work/Life Balance,Fast past environment that doesn't allow a healthy balance of work/life. Compensation and benefits are very low for the work required. Low morale among investigators.,3,1,1,2,2,1
" August 13, 2018","Special Investigator, Risk Decision Group"," Washington, DC ",Investigator,"I really enjoy working as an investigator. The hours are flexible and I feel supported in my work. It's a tough job with a steep learning curve, but it is fun and interesting.",5,0,0,0,0,0
" June 2, 2018",Reviewer," Washington, DC ",productivity and quality,"A typical day at work is production on cases making sure quality is insured.
I have learned to be on time at all times and meet all possible deadlines.
Depending on manager it can be discouraging at times with statistics.
Workplace culture is not that diverse.
The hardest part of the job is meeting quotas.
The most enjoyable part is working from home.",4,3,4,3,3,2
