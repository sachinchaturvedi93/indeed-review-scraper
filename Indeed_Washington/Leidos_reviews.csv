My mgr micromanages me to a point where I have no autonomy, not trusted to make any decisions, criticized for anything I say & do and don't even do what I was originally hired to do a year ago. I asked my mgr for a letter of recommendation to satisfy my grad college app. He coudln't be bothered. This is Leidos? Really?

" February 24, 2019",Administrative Assistant," Washington, DC ",Know what you're getting into,"I work for Leidos as a contractor. My first contracting job. Not happy with it. No job security. Contractors are treated like step-kids. Leidos' interest is their client - the government. Government pays top dollar for contractor services (they're interested in contractor skills, not giving them health benefits) Leidos gives employees a fraction of what they're paid. Contractor gets played on both ends - by the government and Leidos. Better to have a job that pays good money and cares enough about employees to also provide health benefits.
