It grew to be a hostile work environment due to lack of supervision or consequences for not doing your job. The individuals who cared to produce were not supported by supervision. No coaching on work performance was administered to individuals that had complaints filed against them. These individuals were simply moved to other lines to become someone else's problem. No follow-up feedback was ever taken to see if these individuals performed better on a different line. Consequently, I was fired after a disagreement with a temporary employee who had repeatedly been coached by me on his performance & expectations. I had also issued several complaints to appropriate supervision with no result. It was determined that I had broken a code that was not disclosed to me at the time of termination. I believe my true ""crime"" was the fact that I am diabetic and ""a liability"" as stated by the HR personnel following a diabetic episode.
