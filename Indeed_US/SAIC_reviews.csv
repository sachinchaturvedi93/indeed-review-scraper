Professional training was promised but actually getting any was like pulling teeth. I received one training course in about 4 years. As a professional who needs to stay current in their industry, this was unacceptable. I am leaving in large part due to these things.

I have been the target of this. I came on in a time where there was a ton of work they were behind on, and I took on every single project they allowed me to. I stressed for months but was super happy and felt like I was helping the team tremendously. I was pulled aside one day by two of my managers for taking too long of a lunch more than once (absolutely fair of them to do so on this point, I was working too much) but then was shocked to learn that both of them agreed that I was an 'egotistical monster' and that I needed to understand that this wasn't going to be a 'one-man studio'...

There are some employees out to sabotage your position and it's allowed as management would take things at face value rather than investigate to confirm what is said is the truth. One must bow down to seasoned employees to keep the peace and when you don't you're dealing with immature employees until they tire of the situation and go on to the next victim.
