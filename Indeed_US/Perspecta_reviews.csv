My background made transitioning to this job somewhat easy. The training was heavily focused on one type of interview which I learned very well and then got to the field and conducted 1-2 a month on average. The rest of the stuff that was kind of glossed over in training made up the majority of my work and I felt ill prepared to complete it. Review can be frustrating because most refiles count against your stats even if the reviewer was incorrect. So basically you can be penalized for doing the job correctly. When it comes to credit for the work you do, I work a rural area and sometimes have to drive an hour away only to not be able to track someone down. I will get paid for this time but will receive 0 credit and it will appear as though I have done nothing for those hours worked. Because the amount of credit you earn per hour is tied to your promotions and bonuses (the only way to get a pay increase) working in a rural area is difficult. The expectations for the amount of work you will complete are the same as working in a large metro area like DFW. With all that, I would imagine I would be more satisfied with this job if I was doing it in a large city but if that isn’t the case you will likely have a hard time.

This Corporation has a total lack of respect and dignity for the hard-working citizens that provide security for the nation of the United States. Compensation has never changed for over 10 years, since 2009. This Corporation has a blind integrity for suitable payment, because the investigator must provide their personal resources for productivity. No payment increases are provided because the company falsely claims that their bonuses compensates raise increase. Bonuses are provided only during major national holidays; in other words, if you want a bonus expect to work during Christmas. The contractor liaisons that is assigned to mediate between contractors are useless and normally punked down to have any effect. Contract investigators are overworked for very little pay; $200 commission and no compensation for travel or personal resources utilized; i.e., electricity, printer paper, ink, gas.

-work from home office

-exposure to people in a variety of professions and industries

Cons:
-there's a lot of work to be done and unless you get a *good mentor and a reasonable supervisor, you're in for a difficult learning curve---a *stressful learning curve.
-once you get over that curve, you have to maintain an increasing workload
-repetitive work

Other info:
-though the work is repetitive, you're always in different locations and aren't stuck in your office all day.
-learned about different contractors and fed agencies in my area
-made contacts in different organizations
-my management is great, though you sometimes get the feeling that you're working a lot more cases and getting paid less than people in other similar companies (several colleagues of mine have left to different organizations and I'm aware their compensation is much higher and with lower case loads).",5.0,5,4,5,5,3

" January 3, 2019",Background Investigator, Oregon ,It's Not Worth It,"Like many others, I read all the negative reviews and thought people were just wrong. The training probably should be longer and once you start work you are very unprepared and on your own. The Reports you submit are graded by reviewers, some who have zero experience in the field, and they will rip them apart, sending refile after refile. Some refiles will just point out vague errors because they're not reading reports and trying to do too many reviews in a short amount of time. Each time you turn in a report it comes back with different opinions about your so-called errors. Turnover is definitely happening; investigators aren't treated well. I believe that a lot of Field Managers are doing a fine job, preventing as much minutia as possible to assist their investigators, but they can only do so much. Like many others who have posted reviews here, I have also noticed that this company has the worst pay, $17.54 an hour to start. By the time you have paid for your health, dental, vision, and other benefits, you will be lucky to net $2000 a month. Your work output per week/month will determine if you receive a bonus, and you aren't going to see a raise worth bragging about. Frustration sets in and there are many, many, many days that it's easy to walk away. A typical week, since finishing training, is at least 50 or more hours, and over 500 miles driven.

In some cases the pay cuts can be as high as 30%. Renewing an option year on a contract or being moved to another contract are events that result in employee pay cuts. Staff reductions are common place. Perspecta management positions are exclusively filled by retired military personnel as a result there is no upward mobility for college educated professional employees. A portion of the management is retired in place, their only concern is drawing a pay check in addition to their government retirement check and provide no value add to the organization. Management takes great pride in reminding employees of the corporate training policy. Vencor’s training policy was “An employee can have all the training the employee wants as long as the training is outside regular business hours and the employee pays all expenses associated with the training”.
