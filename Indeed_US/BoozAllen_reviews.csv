Government contracting seems to use kind of old tech which can be problematic moving on from them. There also seems to always be a lot of bureaucracy to deal with.

As far as contractors they're probably one of the most desirable ones to work with. They don't ditch you if they don't have a contract for you to jump onto (pro and con really).

One key thing to note is if you're being hired for the bench. I didn't realize I was not going straight onto a contract so it was a bit nerve-racking not being on a billed contract. The bench refers to employees they have on the payroll that aren't being billed to a government contract but they like to have some people there as they want to put people straight onto a contract as contracts come up.

401k: 6% match
PTO: 3 - 4 weeks depending on what level you're being hired on as

Several people moved to other positions to get away from her. She's completely unprofessional, unkind, uncaring and barely even answers her email.

Then there's my coworker.....I've never worked with someone (or even known someone) so ridiculous. She's extremely unprofessional. Two or three contractors left after a couple of months stating her behavior as the reason. She spent at least half of her day, every day on IM gossiping and complaining about everyone and everything-constant negativity. When she wasn't doing it on IM, she was complaining and gossiping to other employees or anyone who happened to come in and even told new hires what a horrible company it was. If anyone said anything to her she took it as them having a fit and I knew the comment was coming as soon as they walked away. She's very good at her job and a very huge manipulator, brown noser and backstabber. Several people came to me and said ""She's horrible"", ""She's so unprofessional"". I found out some absolutely horrible and untrue things she said about me. One minute she was being friendly and the next bashing me. She did the same to everyone else.

" June 30, 2019",Senior Associate," Washington, DC ",Heavy handed company; a shadow of it's former self,"I worked for Booz Allen twice. The first time was for 6 years, before-9/11. The second time was for just over 10 years. In that time, it became a very heavy handed company. During my first stint with Booz, it was a very innovative, smart, and agile consulting company. Certainly top shelf. Today, they lack opportunities for innovation, creativity, and growth. While they claim to “empower people to change the world.” I’ve never seen anyone change anything at Booz Allen. Banding is based on the old Booz Allen, not what exists today.

Post Snowden they setup an insider threat program to monitor employee behavior. When I was there, they made everyone sign a legal waiver to be continually monitored. This included ongoing background checks, credit checks, social media, computer, cell phone, blogs, news reports, etc.

Most work these days is “buts in seats” at government offices under the supervision of a government employee. It can be years before you even visit a Booz Allen facility. Unless you work with your manager onsite, you might only see them once a month or less. You still have to do daily time sheets, annual assessments, and other admin functions. The company no longer provides computers to new employees; no laptop, cell phone, etc. You have to use your own computer for admin functions; other than your timesheet, you can’t do Booz Allen admin functions on a government computer. For the most part, you’re a bit like a temp employee outsourced to a government agency.

Having moved on to a truly innovative company that’s really changing the world, I now see just how bad",1,0,0,0,0,0

Chance to learn new technologies, etc. However, it has classic problems that big corporations have. People looking for ways to advance their careers at the expense of others, people in roles that they shouldn't be because of buddy systems that develop because people are watching each others backs.

My immediate boss at BAH had been there for 3 years. He had a military background and was given the title of Senior Lead Technologist. While he was good at identifying internal needs of co-workers and external needs of clients, I soon realized that he very much struggled with project management and application design.

The sad part here was that he demanded people to follow him to the letter or he would document you in performance plans . Later when I was there he explained that documentation was very important at BAH to get raises internally. I very much disliked their corporate policies. and their way of establishing your value to the company.

I am kind of a slow starter and desperately fought to regain my reputation from an early poor performance evaluation. They explained to me that my PIP (Performance Improvement Plain) was a true reset and that I would not be judged for things that happened early on but this was just not the case.
