" May 8, 2020",Background Investigator, Texas ,Beware! Do not work here!,"Upper management made a bad choice that caused CACI to no longer receive their regular case load from the feds. With barely any cases to work, THOUSANDS of employees went without pay for months and upper management was still paid the entire time. CACI never admitted what really happened and strung employees along for months. CACI didn't want to pay people's unemployment, so they just cornered people into quitting, all the while acting like they were such nice people for not laying anyone off. Sure you didn't lay us off, but you weren't paying us either. Being on leave without pay for months with no answers and no end in sight is not a gift! If you can't afford to/don't want to pay people, at least fire them so they can collect unemployment and pay their bills! During that time, until people started threatening law suits, CACI actually expected new employees to pay back all training costs if they quit. So employees were on leave without pay for months, and if they quit, would have owed the company thousands of dollars. After the threat of law suits, upper management announced that employees would be allowed to quit without repercussions like it was their idea. Zero integrity. Total cowards. Don't care about the employees at all.
CACI says they care about national security, but all they really care about is making money. They create monthly stats that are impossible to meet and turn a blind eye. If you don't meet the stats you will be fired. So you have two choices: work more hours than you'll get paid for and do things correctly, or cut corners and pray you don't get caught.",1,1,1,1,1,1

For the first two months that I turned in expense reports, I submitted my mileage for each day that I traveled for work. I got paid and everything was great. The third time I turned in an expense report, it sat and sat. I contacted the reviewer and he advised that I need to submit the case name and case numbers for each day of travel.

Perhaps that is true for some of their divisions but it wasn't true when it came to their division of Background Investigations. There is little to no room to grow professionally and be promoted. Sure you can increase the level or step of your current position, but to go outside of that role is slim unless you agree to relocate out of state. Internal politics is a big factor in whether or not you will be promoted as well.

We maintained a very positive and professional work environment and a really enjoyable experience.
The hardest part of the job is usually the learning, but learning is only arduous if you detest the people around you, and that was not the case at all. I enjoyed almost everyone I worked with and would do it all over again. I am only saddened by the fact that I had to leave due to lifes journey.

" September 24, 2019",Background Investigator," Ashland, KY ",Section Lead had zero people skills and has no business in Mgmt,"I was disappointed that CACI did not live up to their promises. I was told many times that my productivity stats would NOT be held against me for the first 6 months of the job but that was not true. We were constantly being pressured to do more work w/o doing overtime otherwise we would be charged with timekeeping fraud. I have never received so many threats both in the hiring process and after becoming credentialed. I have come to the conclusion that CACI runs this program by intimidation and OPM should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this. The job is highly bureaucratic and disorganized. You must rely on IT systems that are constantly failing. You have at least 3 levels of review on your reports no matter how good a writer you are and there are people constantly sending your work back to you. One step forward, four steps back.
You will receive a company iPhone so they can monitor your location. You will receive a company laptop but you are not allowed to use ANY Windows or Microsoft software, even if you have better ideas than the mandated software packages, by keeping Microsoft out of the mix you cannot organize your workload properly. Everything about the laptop is strictly controlled. You must use two different VPNs which means half of your programs cannot be on at the same time as others.
